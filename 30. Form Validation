<!-- Use the "onsubmit" event to return a function that makes sure the user has
       filled in all the necessary inputs.
     We use "return" because this reads that if the return is 'false' in the JS,
       it will not allow the submission 	 
     The return after onsubmit is necessary to evaluate the true or false from the JS 
-->

<!-- *** The action page "submitted form data.html" is just a placeholder for example. 
         This will, when in use, be replaced by a .php for data storage and collection *** -->
