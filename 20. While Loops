/* Loops- Allows us to run code repeatedly as many times as we want
   without having to type out the code each time. 
*/

 /* A While loop will run WHILE a condition is true. Once it becomes false, 
    it stops on it's own. Each time the code runs, it is called an 'iteration'.
 */

	
  // SYNTAX
  
   while(condition){
	  Code to run;
	  Increment/Decrement;
	}
	
	
	var counter = 1;    // This way the while loop starts at 1
	
	while(counter <= 10){    //While the var "counter (1)" is <= 10, run the code
	  document.write("This is counter " +counter+ " </br>");
	  counter ++;    //Increment the count by 1 each time until it gets to <= 10
	}

/*
 This is the result of the above loop:
	
 This is counter 1
 This is counter 2
 This is counter 3
 This is counter 4
 This is counter 5
 This is counter 6
 This is counter 7
 This is counter 8
 This is counter 9
 This is counter 10
