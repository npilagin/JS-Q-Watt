/* Do While Loop- If you want your code to run at least once before even
   checking if the condition is true or false. It will run, then check,
   then run more if true, or stop if false.

  do{
    code to run;
	  increment/decrement amount
  }while(condition);

This is the result of this 'do while loop'
   
This is iteration 1
This is iteration 2
This is iteration 3
This is iteration 4
This is iteration 5
This is iteration 6
This is iteration 7
This is iteration 8
This is iteration 9
This is iteration 10

 /*
In this do while loop, the condition is false before anything is even checked
but the do while loop will still run once before the condition is checked

This is iteration 11
